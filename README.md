![Adapty: CRM for mobile apps with subscriptions](/adapty.png)

Adapty SDK is an open-source framework that makes implementing in-app subscriptions in iOS fast and easy. Itâ€™s 100% open-source, native and lightweight.

## SDK unlocks all features of Adapty:

- [A/B testing](https://docs.adapty.io/purchase-infrastructure/ab-tests)  
Increase the revenue by testing different offers, messages, and designs simultaneously, all without new app releases.
- [Promo campaigns](https://docs.adapty.io/profiles-and-promo-campaigns/promo-campaigns)  
Help you to increase revenue with targeted offers for your customers. You can use them to upsell, convert freemium users to paid ones, and win back churned subscribers.
- [Subscribers CRM](https://docs.adapty.io/profiles-and-promo-campaigns/profiles)  
With Profiles CRM you can explore the full payment path of a user including billing issues, grace periods, and other events. You can also analyze users properties such as subscription state, total revenue/proceeds, last seen, and more.
- [Subscription events](https://docs.adapty.io/analytics/integrations)  
Adapty receives info about your customer behavior and converts it into 16 human-readable events, like **`subscription_initial_purchase`**, **`trial_converted`**, **`subscription_cancelled`**, etc.
- Purchase infrastructure
- and much more :fire:
